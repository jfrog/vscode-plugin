# Installing and updating skills

Install and update both download from the registry, so they share the same
`--repo`/`--quiet` rules, blocked-download (403 / Xray) handling, and
verify-landed check.

Install by **slug** (the registry `slug`/`name`, never a display name). Always
resolve and pass a concrete version and repository. Never install with
`--version "latest"` and never choose the first repository as a default.
**The `jf skills install` command takes no project.** Resolving which repo hosts
the slug uses `--list-skill-versions` (below), which does require `--project`, so
use `<PROJECT>` resolved at session start (see SKILL.md Prerequisites).

```bash
jf skills install "<slug>" \
  --server-id "<SID>" \
  --version "<version>" \
  --repo "<repo>" \
  --harness "<harness>" \
  --quiet
```

If the download returns **HTTP 403**, the archive is Xray-gated, not a
permissions or "not found" problem. See *Handling a blocked download
(403 / Xray-gated)* below.

**Always pass `--quiet`.** `jf skills install`/`update` opens an interactive
prompt by default, and an agent's shell has no TTY, so without `--quiet` the
prompt fails (it can abort with `panic: device not configured`). `--quiet` also
defaults to `$CI`, so exporting `CI=true` has the same effect if the flag is ever
unavailable. Run non-interactively and resolve every choice (`--repo`, target)
up front.

**Resolve `<harness>` from the environment check script — never from your model
name.** If `<UA>` is not already known from this session, run
`bash <skill_path>/../jfrog/scripts/check-environment.sh <model-slug>` now and capture
its stdout as `<UA>`. Parse the `tool=<h>` field from `<UA>` and map it to a
`jf` harness name:

| `tool=` value in `<UA>` | `--harness` for `jf skills` |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| `claude` | `claude-code` |
| `cursor` | `cursor` |
| `copilot` | `github-copilot` |
| `unknown`, empty, or any other | Ask the user |

If `tool` is `unknown`, empty, or not in the table — do **not** guess. Ask
the user for the desired install path and use `--path <dir>` instead.
**Exception — Kiro (install only):** if you're self-identified as Kiro (IDE
or `kiro-cli`, per your system prompt — `check-environment.sh` doesn't
detect it), `--harness kiro` is rejected by `jf`, so skip asking and use
`--path` with `.kiro/skills` (project) / `~/.kiro/skills` (global, or
`$KIRO_HOME/skills` if `KIRO_HOME` is set) directly. This exception does not
extend to `jf skills list` — see *List currently installed skills* in
`managing-installed-skills.md`.

Choose exactly one install target (these are mutually exclusive):

| Flag | Installs into |
|------|---------------|
| `--harness <name>` | The current agent's resolved skills dir (resolve per above, e.g. `cursor`, `claude-code`). |
| `--global` | Each agent's global directory from config. |
| `--project-dir <dir>` | Project root combined with the agent's project path. |
| `--path <dir>` | Direct: files go under `<dir>/<slug>`. |

**Always resolve and pass a concrete `--version` and `--repo`.** When the platform
has more than one skills repository (the common case), `jf skills install`
errors with `multiple skills repositories found … specify --repo` if you omit
it, even when the skill lives in only one repo. Resolve both values from exactly
one Agent Guard call:

```bash
npx --yes --registry <REGISTRY_URL> @jfrog/agent-guard \
  --list-skill-versions --project "<PROJECT>" --skill "<slug>" --allowed-only [--server "<SID>"] --format json
# read versions[].version and versions[].locations[].repoKey
```

**Resolve the repo and version only via `--list-skill-versions`.** The catalog
listing (`--list-skills`, even with `--name`) returns just names, not repos or
versions, so use the versions call above to pick the repo, never a name listing.

Resolve choices in this order:

1. **Version first.**
   - If the user named a version, verify that exact value exists in
     `versions[].version`. If absent, stop and offer the returned versions with
     the picker described below. Do not make another catalog call.
   - If the user did not name a version and exactly one version exists, use that
     concrete version without asking.
   - If the user did not name a version and more than one exists, ask which
     version to install. Present versions newest first. Never assume the newest,
     `"latest"`, or the first response entry.
   - If no versions exist, report that the skill is unavailable for the project
     and stop.

2. **Repository second.** After settling the version, use only that version
   object's `locations[]`; discard locations attached to every other version.
   Do not make another catalog call.
   - If the user named a repo, verify it is among the selected version's
     locations. If absent, say that repo is not governance-allowed for the
     project and stop. Never retry without the policy filter or inspect the repo
     directly.
   - If exactly one repo hosts the selected version, use its `repoKey` without
     asking.
   - If more than one repo hosts the selected version, ask which repo to use.
     Never pick the first or the most recently updated-looking repo: equal
     slug+version values in different repos can contain different skills.
   - If the selected version has no returned locations, report it unavailable
     for the project and stop.

## Choice UI

Use the agent surface's native interactive single-choice picker (an arrow-key
selectable menu) whenever a version or repo choice is required and such a
picker is available to the skill. Do not print a table and wait for a typed
reply when a picker is available.

**GitHub Copilot Chat (this harness) has no such picker.** Skills here run as
chat-turn instructions with no programmatic access to VS Code's native
`showQuickPick` UI, so always use the Markdown table fallback below for
version and repo choices — never claim or imply an arrow-key picker exists.

- Version picker: label each option with only the version string, newest first.
  Do not include repo keys before the version is settled.
- Repo picker: label each option with only its `repoKey`. Put
  `<slug>@<version>` in that option's description or subtitle, not its label.
- Do not append "(allowed)" to repo labels. Every returned location is already
  allowed.
- Fall back to a Markdown table followed by a plain-language question. Use one
  **Version** column (newest first) for versions or one **Repository** column
  (`repoKey` only) for repos, and name `<slug>@<version>` in the repo
  question. Never add an "(allowed)" annotation.

## When evidence verification fails

If install fails with `evidence verification failed … no evidence found`, the
skill has **no signed evidence/attestation** (proof it's genuine and scanned).
This is a security control. **Do not silently bypass it.** Stop and ask using
**this exact template**:

> `<slug>@<version>` has no signed evidence (proof it is genuine and scanned).
> Installing it skips that security check. Do you want to install it anyway?

Only if the user explicitly agrees, re-run with
`JFROG_SKILLS_DISABLE_QUIET_FAILURE=true`. Never set that flag on your own.

## Handling a blocked download (403 / Xray-gated)

A `jf skills install`/`update` download can return **HTTP 403** even when the
slug, version, and repo are all correct, because the skill archive is gated by Xray
and Artifactory will not serve it until the scan resolves. Do **not** report
this as a permissions or "not found" problem. Query the skill's Xray status to
find out why (the path is the archive `<slug>/<version>/<slug>-<version>.zip`,
URL-encoded):

```bash
jf api --server-id "<SID>" \
  '/artifactory/api/skills/<repo>/xrayStatus?path=<slug>%2F<version>%2F<slug>-<version>.zip'
```

Interpret the `status` field in the response:

- **`SCAN_IN_PROGRESS`.** Xray is still scanning the archive. The download is
  temporarily gated, not blocked. **Do not retry in a tight loop.** Reply using
  **this exact template**:

  > `<slug>@<version>` is still being scanned by Xray and isn't available to
  > download yet. I can retry in a moment if you'd like.

  If it stays `SCAN_IN_PROGRESS` after a couple of polls, switch to **this exact
  template** instead:

  > `<slug>@<version>` is still being scanned by Xray and is taking longer than
  > expected. Try again later, or check with your JFrog administrator if it never
  > clears.
- **Blocked by a policy** (a blocked/violating status, with the offending
  policy in the response body). The skill is **blocked by an Xray policy**.
  Stop. Do not retry. Reply using **this exact template**, filling the
  placeholders:

  > `<slug>@<version>` is **blocked by the Xray policy `<policy-name>`** and
  > cannot be installed. Contact your JFrog administrator to review or resolve
  > the policy.
- **Any other status, or a non-zero `jf api` exit** (`jf api` signals a non-2xx
  response via its exit code plus a stderr `[Warn] … returned NNN` line — see the
  base `jfrog` skill's *CLI and `jf api`* gotchas). Treat as an operational
  failure (auth, endpoint disabled): the deliberate **free-form** case — report
  the CLI error verbatim (no template), but still strip the `Trace ID`.

## Verify the install landed

After install, confirm the `SKILL.md` exists at the resolved install location
before reporting success:

```bash
test -f "<install-dir>/<slug>/SKILL.md" && echo "installed" || echo "MISSING SKILL.md"
```

If the file is missing, report the failure. Do not claim success.

On success, reply using **this exact template**:

> Installed `<slug>@<version>` from `<repo>` into `<harness>`.
> Restart your agent session to load it.

## Update an installed skill

To upgrade an installed skill to a newer version, use the CLI (it re-downloads
and reinstalls in place):

```bash
jf skills update "<slug>" --server-id "<SID>" --harness "<harness>" --version "latest" --quiet
# Preview without touching Artifactory:
jf skills update "<slug>" --server-id "<SID>" --harness "<harness>" --dry-run
# Reinstall even if already at the target version:
jf skills update "<slug>" --server-id "<SID>" --harness "<harness>" --force --quiet
```

Use the same install-target flag (`--harness`/`--global`/`--project-dir`/
`--path`) the skill was installed with. After updating, re-verify the `SKILL.md`
(see *Verify the install landed* above). If the update download 403s, handle it
as in *Handling a blocked download* above.

On success, reply using **this exact template**:

> Updated `<slug>` to `<version>` (`<harness>`).
> Restart your agent session to load it.

If the skill was already current:

> `<slug>` is already at the latest version (`<version>`). Nothing to update.
